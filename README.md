# Unity_CharacterController
This is my simple State Machine Character Controller.

For nowadays version this State Machine has 3 states:
* Idling State
* Walking State
* Jumping State

For each state I use Character Controller to move Player Object.

To track input controls this project uses InputSystem.

For camera controls was used CinemachineVirtualCamera. Also I added some zoom effect for it.
